## STEP 1: Initial Transaction Review
Analyze the following transaction for potential money laundering indicators:

**Transaction Details:**
- Amount: ${amount} ${currency}
- Type: ${transaction_type}
- Origin: ${origin_country} → Destination: ${destination_country}
- Parties: ${parties}
- Timestamp: ${timestamp}
${intermediate_info}
${crypto_info}

## STEP 2: Red Flag Assessment
Let me systematically evaluate each potential red flag category:

### A. Geographic Risk Analysis
- Is the origin/destination a high-risk jurisdiction? (FATF Grey/Black list)
- Are there intermediate countries that suggest layering?
- Is there a logical business reason for this routing?

### B. Transaction Pattern Analysis
- Does the amount suggest structuring (just below reporting thresholds)?
- Is this consistent with the customer's known activity?
- Are there velocity concerns?

### C. Party/Entity Risk
- Are any parties on sanctions lists?
- Are there shell company indicators?
- Is there PEP involvement?

### D. Documentation Review
- Do documents support the stated purpose?
- Are there discrepancies or anomalies?
- Is there evidence of trade-based laundering?

## STEP 3: Historical Context
**Customer Profile:**
- Account Age: ${account_age_days} days
- Customer Type: ${customer_type}
- Previous Transaction History: ${transaction_history_summary}

## STEP 4: Synthesis & Conclusion
Based on my step-by-step analysis, I will now provide:
1. Overall Risk Assessment (0-100 score)
2. Primary Risk Indicators (list of specific concerns)
3. Recommended Actions (escalate, monitor, clear, file SAR)
4. Confidence Level (how certain am I in this assessment)
